As a result, there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>Next, let\u2019s proceed with feature scaling. Feature scaling is essential for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the features, such as k-NN and SVM. We will use Min-Max scaling to scale the features to a range of [0,\u00a01].</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler<br><br># Define the features and the target<br>X = water_data.drop('Potability', axis=1)<br>y = water_data['Potability']<br><br># Initialize the MinMaxScaler<br>scaler = MinMaxScaler()<br><br># Fit and transform the features<br>X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X), columns=X.columns)<br><br># Display the first few rows of the scaled features<br>X_scaled.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>         ph  Hardness    Solids  Chloramines   Sulfate  Conductivity  \\<br>0  0.505771  0.571139  0.336096     0.543891  0.680385      0.669439   <br>1  0.265434  0.297400  0.300611     0.491839  0.581699      0.719411   <br>2  0.578509  0.641311  0.321619     0.698543  0.581699      0.414652   <br>3  0.594055  0.605536  0.356244     0.603314  0.647347      0.317880   <br>4  0.649445  0.484851  0.289922     0.484900  0.514545      0.379337   <br><br>   Organic_carbon  Trihalomethanes  Turbidity  <br>0        0.313402         0.699753   0.286091  <br>1        0.497319         0.450999   0.576793  <br>2        0.562017         0.532866   0.303637  <br>3        0.622089         0.808065   0.601015  <br>4        0.358555         0.253606   0.496327  </pre>\n<p>We have successfully scaled the features to a range of [0, 1] using Min-Max scaling.

However, if needed, feature engineering could involve creating new features based on existing ones to improve model performance.</p>\n<p>Lastly, let\u2019s briefly check for outliers. We will visualize the box plots of the features to identify any potential outliers</p>\n<pre># Initialize the figure<br>plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))<br><br># Loop over the columns to create subplots for each variable<br>for i, column in enumerate(X_scaled.columns, 1):<br>    plt.subplot(3, 3, i)<br>    sns.boxplot(x=X_scaled[column])<br>    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {column}')<br><br># Adjust the layout<br>plt.tight_layout()<br><br># Show the plots<br>plt.show()</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7KlFldzsc8OPqk9O\"></figure><p>The box plots visualize the distribution of each feature and help identify potential outliers. Outliers are typically represented by the points beyond the \u201cwhiskers\u201d of the box\u00a0plot.</p>\n<p>From the box plots, we can observe that several features exhibit potential outliers. However, dealing with outliers requires careful consideration, as they can sometimes hold valuable information. A common approach to handling outliers is to apply transformations, cap/floor extreme values, or remove them. However, given that the dataset is related to water quality, and extreme values could be indicative of significant issues or variations in water quality, we may opt not to remove them for this analysis.</p>\n<p>This concludes the Modify phase, where we have handled missing values, scaled features, and checked for outliers.</p>\n<h3>Phase 4:\u00a0Model</h3>\n<p>In the Model phase, we will perform the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Splitting</strong>: Split the dataset into training and testing\u00a0sets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the\u00a0task.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Training</strong>: Train the selected models on the training\u00a0data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hyperparameter Tuning</strong>: Tune the model parameters for better performance, if necessary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Comparison</strong>: Compare the performance of different models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by splitting the data into training and testing sets.

The goal was to build models to predict whether water is potable based on several features.</p>\n<h4>Sample Phase:</h4>\n<p>We started by loading the dataset, which consisted of 3276 entries and 10 columns, representing different water quality metrics. Given the manageable size of the dataset, no further sampling was required.</p>\n<h4>Explore Phase:</h4>\n<p>During the exploration, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). We visualized the distributions of individual variables, identified the presence of missing values in the ph, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes columns, and observed an imbalance in the target variable Potability. The correlation matrix revealed low linear correlations between features and the target, indicating the potential complexity of relationships within the\u00a0data.</p>\n<h4>Modify Phase:</h4>\n<p>In the modification phase, we addressed the identified data issues. We imputed missing values using the mean strategy, scaled the features using Min-Max scaling, and visually inspected the dataset for outliers. We decided not to remove outliers, considering their potential significance in water quality variation.</p>\n<h4>Model Phase:</h4>\n<p>We trained and evaluated five different classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The Logistic Regression model struggled, predicting only the majority class. The other models showed varying degrees of success, with SVC and Gradient Boosting Classifier demonstrating the best balance between precision and recall and achieving accuracies around 66%66%. However, all models had challenges with recall for the potable class, potentially due to class imbalance and feature complexity.</p>\n<h4>Assess Phase:</h4>\n<p>In the final assessment, we summarized the performances of the models and made several recommendations. The SVC and Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the most promising models, with balanced precision and slightly higher accuracy. However, there is room for improvement. Advanced techniques like resampling, feature engineering, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning could be explored to enhance model performance. Additionally, considering the critical nature of water quality, the choice of the model in real-world applications would involve careful consideration of the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>\n<p>This analysis provided valuable insights into water potability prediction using machine learning models. It highlighted the challenges arising from class imbalance, feature complexity, and the significance of choosing the right model based on the application context. Future work should explore advanced techniques and optimizations to build more robust and reliable models for water potability prediction.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=97d489b49781\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h3>Crystalline Insights: Applying SEMMA Methodology for Predictive Modeling of Water Potability with Machine\u00a0Learning</h3>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental human need and a cornerstone of public health.

The specific tasks\u00a0include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Missing Values</strong>: Impute or remove the missing values identified in the Explore\u00a0phase.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Scaling/Normalization</strong>: Scale or normalize the features to bring them to a similar scale, which is essential for distance-based algorithms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create new features if necessary to improve model performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: If there are any categorical variables, encode them to numerical format.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Outliers</strong>: Identify and handle outliers in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with handling missing values.

One common strategy is to impute the missing values with the mean or median of the respective column.</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer<br><br># Create a SimpleImputer object with a strategy to replace missing values with the mean of the column<br>imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')<br><br># Apply the imputer to the columns with missing values<br>water_data[['ph', 'Sulfate', 'Trihalomethanes']] = imputer.fit_transform(water_data[['ph', 'Sulfate', 'Trihalomethanes']])<br><br># Verify if there are any missing values left in the dataset<br>missing_values_after_imputation = water_data.isnull().sum().sum()<br>missing_values_after_imputation</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>0</pre>\n<p>We have successfully imputed the missing values in the columns ph, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes using the mean of the respective columns. As a result, there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>Next, let\u2019s proceed with feature scaling. Feature scaling is essential for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the features, such as k-NN and SVM. We will use Min-Max scaling to scale the features to a range of [0,\u00a01].</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler<br><br># Define the features and the target<br>X = water_data.drop('Potability', axis=1)<br>y = water_data['Potability']<br><br># Initialize the MinMaxScaler<br>scaler = MinMaxScaler()<br><br># Fit and transform the features<br>X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X), columns=X.columns)<br><br># Display the first few rows of the scaled features<br>X_scaled.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>         ph  Hardness    Solids  Chloramines   Sulfate  Conductivity  \\<br>0  0.505771  0.571139  0.336096     0.543891  0.680385      0.669439   <br>1  0.265434  0.297400  0.300611     0.491839  0.581699      0.719411   <br>2  0.578509  0.641311  0.321619     0.698543  0.581699      0.414652   <br>3  0.594055  0.605536  0.356244     0.603314  0.647347      0.317880   <br>4  0.649445  0.484851  0.289922     0.484900  0.514545      0.379337   <br><br>   Organic_carbon  Trihalomethanes  Turbidity  <br>0        0.313402         0.699753   0.286091  <br>1        0.497319         0.450999   0.576793  <br>2        0.562017         0.532866   0.303637  <br>3        0.622089         0.808065   0.601015  <br>4        0.358555         0.253606   0.496327  </pre>\n<p>We have successfully scaled the features to a range of [0, 1] using Min-Max scaling. The scaled features are now stored in X_scaled, and the target variable remains in\u00a0y.</p>\n<p>For this dataset, we don\u2019t have categorical variables that need encoding, and we will not perform additional feature engineering at this point. However, if needed, feature engineering could involve creating new features based on existing ones to improve model performance.</p>\n<p>Lastly, let\u2019s briefly check for outliers. We will visualize the box plots of the features to identify any potential outliers</p>\n<pre># Initialize the figure<br>plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))<br><br># Loop over the columns to create subplots for each variable<br>for i, column in enumerate(X_scaled.columns, 1):<br>    plt.subplot(3, 3, i)<br>    sns.boxplot(x=X_scaled[column])<br>    plt.title(f'Box Plot of {column}')<br><br># Adjust the layout<br>plt.tight_layout()<br><br># Show the plots<br>plt.show()</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7KlFldzsc8OPqk9O\"></figure><p>The box plots visualize the distribution of each feature and help identify potential outliers. Outliers are typically represented by the points beyond the \u201cwhiskers\u201d of the box\u00a0plot.</p>\n<p>From the box plots, we can observe that several features exhibit potential outliers. However, dealing with outliers requires careful consideration, as they can sometimes hold valuable information. A common approach to handling outliers is to apply transformations, cap/floor extreme values, or remove them. However, given that the dataset is related to water quality, and extreme values could be indicative of significant issues or variations in water quality, we may opt not to remove them for this analysis.</p>\n<p>This concludes the Modify phase, where we have handled missing values, scaled features, and checked for outliers.</p>\n<h3>Phase 4:\u00a0Model</h3>\n<p>In the Model phase, we will perform the following tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Splitting</strong>: Split the dataset into training and testing\u00a0sets.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Selection</strong>: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for the\u00a0task.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Training</strong>: Train the selected models on the training\u00a0data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hyperparameter Tuning</strong>: Tune the model parameters for better performance, if necessary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Model Comparison</strong>: Compare the performance of different models.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by splitting the data into training and testing sets.

The goal was to build models to predict whether water is potable based on several features.</p>\n<h4>Sample Phase:</h4>\n<p>We started by loading the dataset, which consisted of 3276 entries and 10 columns, representing different water quality metrics. Given the manageable size of the dataset, no further sampling was required.</p>\n<h4>Explore Phase:</h4>\n<p>During the exploration, we conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA). We visualized the distributions of individual variables, identified the presence of missing values in the ph, Sulfate, and Trihalomethanes columns, and observed an imbalance in the target variable Potability. The correlation matrix revealed low linear correlations between features and the target, indicating the potential complexity of relationships within the\u00a0data.</p>\n<h4>Modify Phase:</h4>\n<p>In the modification phase, we addressed the identified data issues. We imputed missing values using the mean strategy, scaled the features using Min-Max scaling, and visually inspected the dataset for outliers. We decided not to remove outliers, considering their potential significance in water quality variation.</p>\n<h4>Model Phase:</h4>\n<p>We trained and evaluated five different classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The Logistic Regression model struggled, predicting only the majority class. The other models showed varying degrees of success, with SVC and Gradient Boosting Classifier demonstrating the best balance between precision and recall and achieving accuracies around 66%66%. However, all models had challenges with recall for the potable class, potentially due to class imbalance and feature complexity.</p>\n<h4>Assess Phase:</h4>\n<p>In the final assessment, we summarized the performances of the models and made several recommendations. The SVC and Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the most promising models, with balanced precision and slightly higher accuracy. However, there is room for improvement. Advanced techniques like resampling, feature engineering, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning could be explored to enhance model performance. Additionally, considering the critical nature of water quality, the choice of the model in real-world applications would involve careful consideration of the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.</p>\n<h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>\n<p>This analysis provided valuable insights into water potability prediction using machine learning models. It highlighted the challenges arising from class imbalance, feature complexity, and the significance of choosing the right model based on the application context. Future work should explore advanced techniques and optimizations to build more robust and reliable models for water potability prediction.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=97d489b49781\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["kaggle-dataset","machine-learning","data-science"]},{"title":"Harnessing the Power of KDD: A Comprehensive Study on Stroke Risk Identification through Predictive\u2026","pubDate":"2023-09-25 05:39:52","link":"https://medium.com/@omkarnagarkar55/harnessing-the-power-of-kdd-a-comprehensive-study-on-stroke-risk-identification-through-predictive-36e9ee66d961?source=rss-1570a9cc3a3f------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/36e9ee66d961","author":"Omkar Nagarkar","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h3><strong>Harnessing the Power of KDD: A Comprehensive Study on Stroke Risk Identification through Predictive Modeling</strong></h3>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>In the realm of healthcare, where early identification of disease risk can be a game-changer, leveraging advanced methodologies is crucial. Stroke, a leading contributor to global morbidity and mortality, is one such condition where timely intervention can make all the difference. In our pursuit to unearth predictive insights, we embarked on a journey through the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) methodology, exploring various classification algorithms to develop an optimal predictive model for identifying individuals at elevated risk of experiencing a\u00a0stroke.</p>\n<p><strong>Dataset Used: </strong><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset\">Kaggle\u00a0Dataset</a>.</p>\n<h4>Methodology: The KDD Framework</h4>\n<p>The Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process consists of several phases that allow us to derive valuable insights and knowledge from raw data. The main phases in the KDD methodology are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Understanding</strong>: Define the objectives and requirements from a business perspective, and then convert this knowledge into a data mining problem definition.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Understanding</strong>: Initial data collection and exploration to familiarize with the data, identify data quality issues, discover first insights into the data, and detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Preparation</strong>: The data is cleaned, transformed, and engineered for modeling. This phase includes tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and feature selection.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Modeling</strong>: Select and apply various modeling techniques and calibrate their parameters to optimal values. Often, several techniques are tried, and their performance is compared.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate the model\u2019s performance with respect to the business objectives, and ensure that it adequately achieves the business objectives.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment</strong>: The knowledge gained is organized and presented in such a way that the customer can use it. Depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining\u00a0process.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Phase 1: Business Understanding</h3>\n<p>In this phase, we define the problem, objectives, and requirements from a business perspective. The goal is to convert this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and develop a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives.</p>\n<h4>Problem Definition:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Objective</strong>: To develop a model that can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have a stroke based on various medical and demographic features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Target Variable</strong>: Outcome (Whether a person will have a stroke or\u00a0not)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Predictor Variables</strong>: Various medical and demographic features available in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Success Criteria</strong>: Achieve high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in stroke prediction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Preliminary Plan:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Understanding</strong>: Explore the dataset to understand the features, their types, and identify any initial patterns or anomalies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering if necessary.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Modeling</strong>: Train various classification models and compare their performances.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Evaluation</strong>: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and\u00a0ROC-AUC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment</strong>: Present the findings and the best model for implementation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now that we have a clear understanding of the business problem and have set our objectives, we will proceed to the next phase, Data Understanding.</p>\n<h3>Phase 2: Data Understanding</h3>\n<p>In the Data Understanding phase, we will perform an initial exploration of the dataset.

This phase includes the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Missing Values</strong>: Identify and impute or remove missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Outliers</strong>: Identify and handle outliers in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for modeling.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Scaling</strong>: Scale numerical features to bring them to a similar\u00a0scale.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Class Imbalance</strong>: Address any class imbalance observed in the target variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Handling Missing\u00a0Values</h4>\n<p>The first step in data preparation is to handle missing values. Missing values in the dataset can lead to biased or incorrect results. The approach to handling missing values can vary based on the nature of the data and the percentage of missing\u00a0values.</p>\n<p>From our initial data exploration, we observed that the \u201cbmi\u201d feature has some missing values. Let\u2019s quantify the extent of missing values in this feature and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle\u00a0them.</p>\n<pre># Calculate the percentage of missing values in the \"bmi\" feature<br>missing_bmi_percentage = data['bmi'].isnull().mean() * 100<br><br># Display the percentage of missing values in \"bmi\"<br>missing_bmi_percentage</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>3.9334637964774952</pre>\n<p>The \u201cbmi\u201d feature has approximately 3.93%3.93% missing values. Given that this is a relatively small proportion of the total dataset, we have several options to handle these missing\u00a0values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Imputation</strong>: Replace missing values with a statistic such as the mean, median, or mode of the\u00a0feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion</strong>: Remove rows with missing values, especially if the number of missing values is\u00a0small.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the percentage of missing values is relatively small, either method could be appropriate. For this analysis, we will opt for imputation, replacing the missing \u201cbmi\u201d values with the median of the \u201cbmi\u201d feature (to reduce the impact of outliers).</p>\n<pre># Impute missing values in the \"bmi\" feature with its median<br>bmi_median = data['bmi'].median()<br>data['bmi'].fillna(bmi_median, inplace=True)<br><br># Verify if there are any remaining missing values in the dataset<br>remaining_missing_values = data.isnull().sum().sum()<br>remaining_missing_values</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>0</pre>\n<p>The missing values in the \u201cbmi\u201d feature have been successfully imputed with the median, and there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>The next step in the Data Preparation phase is handling outliers. Outliers are extreme values that can skew the dataset and potentially affect the performance of the model. We will identify and handle outliers in the numerical features of the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<h4>Handling Outliers</h4>\n<p>Outliers can significantly impact the results of data analysis and statistical modeling. There are various methods to detect and handle outliers, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Z-Score</strong>: The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high absolute value of the Z-score indicates that the data point is far from the\u00a0mean.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IQR (Interquartile Range)</strong>: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data. Data points that fall below <em>Q</em>1\u22121.5\u00d7IQR or above <em>Q</em>3+1.5\u00d7IQR are considered outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this analysis, we will use the IQR method to identify and handle outliers in the numerical features of the dataset. We can either cap the outliers to the nearest non-outlier value or remove the rows containing outliers, depending on the number and nature of the outliers identified.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by identifying outliers in the numerical features using the IQR\u00a0method.</p>\n<pre># List of numerical features for outlier detection<br>numerical_features_for_outliers = ['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi']<br><br># Dictionary to store the indices of outliers for each numerical feature<br>outliers_indices = {}<br><br># Identify outliers using the IQR method<br>for feature in numerical_features_for_outliers:<br>    # Calculate Q1 and Q3<br>    Q1 = data[feature].quantile(0.25)<br>    Q3 = data[feature].quantile(0.75)<br><br>    # Calculate the IQR<br>    IQR = Q3 - Q1<br><br>    # Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers<br>    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR<br>    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR<br><br>    # Find the indices of outliers<br>    outliers = data[(data[feature] &lt; lower_bound) | (data[feature] &gt; upper_bound)].index<br>    outliers_indices[feature] = outliers<br><br># Display the number of outliers identified for each numerical feature<br>outliers_count = {feature: len(indices) for feature, indices in outliers_indices.items()}<br>outliers_count</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>{'age': 0, 'avg_glucose_level': 627, 'bmi': 126}</pre>\n<p>We have identified the following number of outliers in the numerical features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Age</strong>: 0\u00a0outliers</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Average Glucose Level</strong>: 627\u00a0outliers</li>\n<li>\n<strong>BMI</strong>: 126\u00a0outliers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the dataset has 5110 entries, removing all rows containing outliers might result in a significant loss of data. An alternative approach is to cap the outliers to the nearest non-outlier value, thus retaining the data points while mitigating the impact of extreme\u00a0values.</p>\n<pre># Recalculate the number of outliers after capping for each numerical feature<br>outliers_after_capping_count = {}<br><br>for feature in numerical_features_for_outliers:<br>    # Calculate Q1 and Q3<br>    Q1 = data[feature].quantile(0.25)<br>    Q3 = data[feature].quantile(0.75)<br><br>    # Calculate the IQR<br>    IQR = Q3 - Q1<br><br>    # Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers<br>    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR<br>    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR<br><br>    # Find the indices of outliers<br>    outliers = data[(data[feature] &lt; lower_bound) | (data[feature] &gt; upper_bound)].index<br>    outliers_after_capping_count[feature] = len(outliers)<br><br>outliers_after_capping_count</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>{'age': 0, 'avg_glucose_level': 0, 'bmi': 0}</pre>\n<p>After capping the outliers, we have successfully mitigated the impact of extreme values in the dataset. There are now 00 outliers in the features \u201cage\u201d, \u201cavg_glucose_level\u201d, and\u00a0\u201cbmi\u201d.</p>\n<p>The next step in data preparation is encoding categorical variables. Categorical variables need to be converted into a numerical format that can be fed into machine learning models. Common methods for encoding categorical variables include One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.</p>\n<h4>Encoding Categorical Variables</h4>\n<p>Machine learning models require numerical input, so we need to convert categorical variables into a suitable numerical format. The most common techniques for encoding categorical variables are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>One-Hot Encoding</strong>: This method creates binary columns for each category and indicates the presence of the category with an entry of 1. It\u2019s suitable for nominal data where no ordinal relationship exists between the categories.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Label Encoding</strong>: This method assigns each unique category in a categorical variable to an integer. It\u2019s suitable for ordinal data where there is an inherent order between the categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In our dataset, the categorical variables \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018ever_married\u2019, \u2018work_type\u2019, \u2018Residence_type\u2019, and \u2018smoking_status\u2019 are nominal, so we will use One-Hot Encoding for these variables.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s proceed with encoding these categorical variables.</p>\n<pre># List of categorical features for encoding<br>categorical_features_for_encoding = ['gender', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'Residence_type', 'smoking_status']<br><br># Perform One-Hot Encoding for categorical features<br>data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=categorical_features_for_encoding, drop_first=True)<br><br># Display the first few rows of the encoded dataset<br>data_encoded.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>      id   age  hypertension  heart_disease  avg_glucose_level   bmi  stroke  \\<br>0   9046  67.0             0              1           169.3575  36.6       1   <br>1  51676  61.0             0              0           169.3575  28.1       1   <br>2  31112  80.0             0              1           105.9200  32.5       1   <br>3  60182  49.0             0              0           169.3575  34.4       1   <br>4   1665  79.0             1              0           169.3575  24.0       1   <br><br>   gender_Male  gender_Other  ever_married_Yes  work_type_Never_worked  \\<br>0            1             0                 1                       0   <br>1            0             0                 1                       0   <br>2            1             0                 1                       0   <br>3            0             0                 1                       0   <br>4            0             0                 1                       0   <br><br>   work_type_Private  work_type_Self-employed  work_type_children  \\<br>0                  1                        0                   0   <br>1                  0                        1                   0   <br>2                  1                        0                   0   <br>3                  1                        0                   0   <br>4                  0                        1                   0   <br><br>   Residence_type_Urban  smoking_status_formerly smoked  \\<br>0                     1                               1   <br>1                     0                               0   <br>2                     0                               0   <br>3                     1                               0   <br>4                     0                               0   <br><br>   smoking_status_never smoked  smoking_status_smokes  <br>0                            0                      0  <br>1                            1                      0  <br>2                            1                      0  <br>3                            0                      1  <br>4                            1                      0  </pre>\n<p>The categorical variables have been successfully one-hot encoded, resulting in additional binary columns for each category.

This step is essential for models that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as distance-based models.</p>\n<h4>Feature Scaling</h4>\n<p>Feature scaling is a technique used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of the data. Common types of feature scaling methods\u00a0include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Min-Max Scaling</strong>: This method scales the data between 0 and\u00a01.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Standard Scaling (Z-score Normalization)</strong>: This method scales the data based on the mean and standard deviation, resulting in data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of\u00a01.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Robust Scaling</strong>: This method scales the data based on the median and the interquartile range, making it robust to outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this analysis, we will use Standard Scaling to scale the numerical features, as it is a common choice and works well in most scenarios. The numerical features to be scaled are \u2018age\u2019, \u2018avg_glucose_level\u2019, and\u00a0\u2018bmi\u2019.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s proceed with scaling these numerical features.</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler<br><br># List of numerical features for scaling<br>numerical_features_for_scaling = ['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi']<br><br># Initialize the StandardScaler<br>scaler = StandardScaler()<br><br># Apply Standard Scaling to the numerical features<br>data_encoded[numerical_features_for_scaling] = scaler.fit_transform(data_encoded[numerical_features_for_scaling])<br><br># Display the first few rows of the scaled dataset<br>data_encoded.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>      id       age  hypertension  heart_disease  avg_glucose_level       bmi  \\<br>0   9046  1.051434             0              1           2.058363  1.110872   <br>1  51676  0.786070             0              0           2.058363 -0.082921   <br>2  31112  1.626390             0              1           0.148256  0.535043   <br>3  60182  0.255342             0              0           2.058363  0.801890   <br>4   1665  1.582163             1              0           2.058363 -0.658751   <br><br>   stroke  gender_Male  gender_Other  ever_married_Yes  \\<br>0       1            1             0                 1   <br>1       1            0             0                 1   <br>2       1            1             0                 1   <br>3       1            0             0                 1   <br>4       1            0             0                 1   <br><br>   work_type_Never_worked  work_type_Private  work_type_Self-employed  \\<br>0                       0                  1                        0   <br>1                       0                  0                        1   <br>2                       0                  1                        0   <br>3                       0                  1                        0   <br>4                       0                  0                        1   <br><br>   work_type_children  Residence_type_Urban  smoking_status_formerly smoked  \\<br>0                   0                     1                               1   <br>1                   0                     0                               0   <br>2                   0                     0                               0   <br>3                   0                     1                               0   <br>4                   0                     0                               0   <br><br>   smoking_status_never smoked  smoking_status_smokes  <br>0                            0                      0  <br>1                            1                      0  <br>2                            1                      0  <br>3                            0                      1  <br>4                            1                      0  </pre>\n<p>The numerical features \u2018age\u2019, \u2018avg_glucose_level\u2019, and \u2018bmi\u2019 have been successfully scaled using Standard Scaling. The scaled features now have a mean of approximately 0 and a standard deviation of\u00a01.</p>\n<p>The next step in the Data Preparation phase is Feature Engineering, where we can create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance. However, given the nature of the dataset and the features available, there don\u2019t appear to be immediate opportunities for creating meaningful new features.</p>\n<p>After Feature Engineering, we would address any class imbalance observed in the target variable. We noted earlier that the dataset is imbalanced with respect to the target variable \u2018stroke\u2019. Addressing this imbalance can involve resampling techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples.</p>\n<h4>Handling Class Imbalance</h4>\n<p>Class imbalance can lead to a biased model that performs poorly on the minority class. Several techniques can be used to address class imbalance, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Oversampling the Minority Class</strong>: Increasing the number of instances of the minority class by duplicating samples or generating synthetic samples.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Undersampling the Majority Class</strong>: Reducing the number of instances of the majority class by randomly removing\u00a0samples.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Using Different Evaluation Metrics</strong>: Using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC that are more informative than accuracy in imbalanced datasets.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre># Define features (X) and target (y) again<br>X = data_encoded.drop(columns=['id', 'stroke'])<br>y = data_encoded['stroke']<br><br># Concatenate the features and target variable to form the dataset<br>dataset = pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)<br><br># Separate the majority and minority classes<br>majority_class = dataset[dataset['stroke'] == 0]<br>minority_class = dataset[dataset['stroke'] == 1]<br><br># Oversample the minority class<br>minority_class_upsampled = resample(minority_class, <br>                                    replace=True, <br>                                    n_samples=len(majority_class), <br>                                    random_state=42)<br><br># Combine the majority class and the upsampled minority class to form the balanced dataset<br>balanced_dataset = pd.concat([majority_class, minority_class_upsampled])<br><br># Check the class distribution after oversampling<br>class_distribution_after_oversampling = balanced_dataset['stroke'].value_counts(normalize=True)<br>class_distribution_after_oversampling</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>0    0.5<br>1    0.5<br>Name: stroke, dtype: float64</pre>\n<p>After oversampling the minority class, we have successfully balanced the class distribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of the samples belong to the \u201cNo Stroke\u201d class\u00a0(0).</li>\n<li>50% of the samples belong to the \u201cStroke\u201d class\u00a0(1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This balanced dataset should help in training a model that is less biased towards the majority\u00a0class.</p>\n<p>We have now completed the Data Preparation phase, having handled missing values, outliers, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and addressed class imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Phase 4:\u00a0Modeling</h3>\n<p>In the Modeling phase, we will select appropriate modeling techniques, build models, and assess their fit. Given that our task is binary classification (predicting whether a person will have a stroke or not), we will explore the following classification models:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: A simple linear model for binary classification.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decision Tree Classifier</strong>: A non-linear model that partitions the feature space into regions and assigns a class label to each\u00a0region.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>: An ensemble of decision trees that aggregates their predictions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>: A model that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature\u00a0space.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Gradient Boosting Classifier</strong>: A boosting algorithm that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each model, we will perform the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Train the Model</strong>: Use the training data to fit the\u00a0model.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Evaluate the Model</strong>: Use the test data to evaluate the model\u2019s performance based on appropriate metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will start by splitting the balanced dataset into training and testing sets. Then, we will train and evaluate each model one by\u00a0one.</p>\n<h4>Logistic Regression</h4>\n<p>Logistic Regression is one of the simplest algorithms for binary classification.

Specifically, we\u00a0will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Explore the Distribution of Individual Features: Visualize the distribution of individual features to understand their characteristics.</li>\n<li>Explore the Distribution of the Target Variable: Visualize the distribution of the target variable (stroke) to check for class imbalance.</li>\n<li>Explore Relationships Between Features: Visualize relationships between different features and the target variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with exploring the distribution of individual features.</p>\n<pre>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>import seaborn as sns<br><br># Set the style of the visualization<br>sns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")<br><br># Initialize the figure<br>plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))<br><br># Plot the distribution of individual features<br>features = ['gender', 'age', 'hypertension', 'heart_disease', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'Residence_type', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi', 'smoking_status']<br>for i, feature in enumerate(features, 1):<br>    plt.subplot(3, 4, i)<br>    if data[feature].dtype == 'object':<br>        sns.countplot(y=data[feature])<br>        plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')<br>    else:<br>        sns.histplot(data[feature], kde=True)<br>        plt.title(f'Distribution of {feature}')<br><br>plt.tight_layout()<br>plt.show()</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zpL6Y7byum8JC2gI\"></figure><p>From the visual exploration of individual features, we observe the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Gender</strong>: The dataset has more female entries than\u00a0male.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Age</strong>: Age is distributed across all ranges, with a higher concentration of younger individuals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hypertension</strong>: The majority of individuals do not have hypertension.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Heart Disease</strong>: The majority of individuals do not have heart\u00a0disease.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ever Married</strong>: A significant number of individuals have been\u00a0married.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Work Type</strong>: Most individuals work in the private sector, followed by self-employed and children.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Residence Type</strong>: The distribution of urban and rural residence types is approximately equal.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Average Glucose Level</strong>: The distribution is skewed to the right, with a few individuals having high glucose\u00a0levels.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>BMI</strong>: The distribution is also skewed to the right, indicating that most individuals have a BMI in the normal to overweight range.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Smoking Status</strong>: A significant number of individuals have never smoked, followed by those who used to smoke and those who currently smoke.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, let\u2019s explore the distribution of the target variable, \u201cstroke\u201d, to check for any class imbalance</p>\n<pre># Plot the distribution of the target variable \"stroke\"<br>plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))<br>sns.countplot(x=data['stroke'])<br>plt.title('Distribution of Stroke')<br>plt.xlabel('Stroke')<br>plt.ylabel('Count')<br>plt.show()<br><br># Calculate the proportion of each class<br>class_proportion = data['stroke'].value_counts(normalize=True)<br>class_proportion</pre>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vL3D8pbqGFIirV6J\"></figure><p>The distribution of the target variable \u201cstroke\u201d shows a significant class imbalance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Approximately 95.13%95.13% of the samples belong to the \u201cNo Stroke\u201d class\u00a0(0).</li>\n<li>Approximately 4.87%4.87% of the samples belong to the \u201cStroke\u201d class\u00a0(1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Class imbalance can impact the performance of machine learning models, making them biased towards the majority class.

This phase includes the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Missing Values</strong>: Identify and impute or remove missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Outliers</strong>: Identify and handle outliers in the\u00a0dataset.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for modeling.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Scaling</strong>: Scale numerical features to bring them to a similar\u00a0scale.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling Class Imbalance</strong>: Address any class imbalance observed in the target variable.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Handling Missing\u00a0Values</h4>\n<p>The first step in data preparation is to handle missing values. Missing values in the dataset can lead to biased or incorrect results. The approach to handling missing values can vary based on the nature of the data and the percentage of missing\u00a0values.</p>\n<p>From our initial data exploration, we observed that the \u201cbmi\u201d feature has some missing values. Let\u2019s quantify the extent of missing values in this feature and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle\u00a0them.</p>\n<pre># Calculate the percentage of missing values in the \"bmi\" feature<br>missing_bmi_percentage = data['bmi'].isnull().mean() * 100<br><br># Display the percentage of missing values in \"bmi\"<br>missing_bmi_percentage</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>3.9334637964774952</pre>\n<p>The \u201cbmi\u201d feature has approximately 3.93%3.93% missing values. Given that this is a relatively small proportion of the total dataset, we have several options to handle these missing\u00a0values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Imputation</strong>: Replace missing values with a statistic such as the mean, median, or mode of the\u00a0feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion</strong>: Remove rows with missing values, especially if the number of missing values is\u00a0small.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since the percentage of missing values is relatively small, either method could be appropriate. For this analysis, we will opt for imputation, replacing the missing \u201cbmi\u201d values with the median of the \u201cbmi\u201d feature (to reduce the impact of outliers).</p>\n<pre># Impute missing values in the \"bmi\" feature with its median<br>bmi_median = data['bmi'].median()<br>data['bmi'].fillna(bmi_median, inplace=True)<br><br># Verify if there are any remaining missing values in the dataset<br>remaining_missing_values = data.isnull().sum().sum()<br>remaining_missing_values</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>0</pre>\n<p>The missing values in the \u201cbmi\u201d feature have been successfully imputed with the median, and there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>The next step in the Data Preparation phase is handling outliers. Outliers are extreme values that can skew the dataset and potentially affect the performance of the model. We will identify and handle outliers in the numerical features of the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<h4>Handling Outliers</h4>\n<p>Outliers can significantly impact the results of data analysis and statistical modeling. There are various methods to detect and handle outliers, such\u00a0as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Z-Score</strong>: The Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high absolute value of the Z-score indicates that the data point is far from the\u00a0mean.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IQR (Interquartile Range)</strong>: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of the data. Data points that fall below <em>Q</em>1\u22121.5\u00d7IQR or above <em>Q</em>3+1.5\u00d7IQR are considered outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this analysis, we will use the IQR method to identify and handle outliers in the numerical features of the dataset. We can either cap the outliers to the nearest non-outlier value or remove the rows containing outliers, depending on the number and nature of the outliers identified.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by identifying outliers in the numerical features using the IQR\u00a0method.</p>\n<pre># List of numerical features for outlier detection<br>numerical_features_for_outliers = ['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi']<br><br># Dictionary to store the indices of outliers for each numerical feature<br>outliers_indices = {}<br><br># Identify outliers using the IQR method<br>for feature in numerical_features_for_outliers:<br>    # Calculate Q1 and Q3<br>    Q1 = data[feature].quantile(0.25)<br>    Q3 = data[feature].quantile(0.75)<br><br>    # Calculate the IQR<br>    IQR = Q3 - Q1<br><br>    # Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers<br>    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR<br>    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR<br><br>    # Find the indices of outliers<br>    outliers = data[(data[feature] &lt; lower_bound) | (data[feature] &gt; upper_bound)].index<br>    outliers_indices[feature] = outliers<br><br># Display the number of outliers identified for each numerical feature<br>outliers_count = {feature: len(indices) for feature, indices in outliers_indices.items()}<br>outliers_count</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>{'age': 0, 'avg_glucose_level': 627, 'bmi': 126}</pre>\n<p>We have identified the following number of outliers in the numerical features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Age</strong>: 0\u00a0outliers</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Average Glucose Level</strong>: 627\u00a0outliers</li>\n<li>\n<strong>BMI</strong>: 126\u00a0outliers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that the dataset has 5110 entries, removing all rows containing outliers might result in a significant loss of data. An alternative approach is to cap the outliers to the nearest non-outlier value, thus retaining the data points while mitigating the impact of extreme\u00a0values.</p>\n<pre># Recalculate the number of outliers after capping for each numerical feature<br>outliers_after_capping_count = {}<br><br>for feature in numerical_features_for_outliers:<br>    # Calculate Q1 and Q3<br>    Q1 = data[feature].quantile(0.25)<br>    Q3 = data[feature].quantile(0.75)<br><br>    # Calculate the IQR<br>    IQR = Q3 - Q1<br><br>    # Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers<br>    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR<br>    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR<br><br>    # Find the indices of outliers<br>    outliers = data[(data[feature] &lt; lower_bound) | (data[feature] &gt; upper_bound)].index<br>    outliers_after_capping_count[feature] = len(outliers)<br><br>outliers_after_capping_count</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>{'age': 0, 'avg_glucose_level': 0, 'bmi': 0}</pre>\n<p>After capping the outliers, we have successfully mitigated the impact of extreme values in the dataset. There are now 00 outliers in the features \u201cage\u201d, \u201cavg_glucose_level\u201d, and\u00a0\u201cbmi\u201d.</p>\n<p>The next step in data preparation is encoding categorical variables. Categorical variables need to be converted into a numerical format that can be fed into machine learning models. Common methods for encoding categorical variables include One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.</p>\n<h4>Encoding Categorical Variables</h4>\n<p>Machine learning models require numerical input, so we need to convert categorical variables into a suitable numerical format. The most common techniques for encoding categorical variables are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>One-Hot Encoding</strong>: This method creates binary columns for each category and indicates the presence of the category with an entry of 1. It\u2019s suitable for nominal data where no ordinal relationship exists between the categories.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Label Encoding</strong>: This method assigns each unique category in a categorical variable to an integer. It\u2019s suitable for ordinal data where there is an inherent order between the categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In our dataset, the categorical variables \u2018gender\u2019, \u2018ever_married\u2019, \u2018work_type\u2019, \u2018Residence_type\u2019, and \u2018smoking_status\u2019 are nominal, so we will use One-Hot Encoding for these variables.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s proceed with encoding these categorical variables.</p>\n<pre># List of categorical features for encoding<br>categorical_features_for_encoding = ['gender', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'Residence_type', 'smoking_status']<br><br># Perform One-Hot Encoding for categorical features<br>data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=categorical_features_for_encoding, drop_first=True)<br><br># Display the first few rows of the encoded dataset<br>data_encoded.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>      id   age  hypertension  heart_disease  avg_glucose_level   bmi  stroke  \\<br>0   9046  67.0             0              1           169.3575  36.6       1   <br>1  51676  61.0             0              0           169.3575  28.1       1   <br>2  31112  80.0             0              1           105.9200  32.5       1   <br>3  60182  49.0             0              0           169.3575  34.4       1   <br>4   1665  79.0             1              0           169.3575  24.0       1   <br><br>   gender_Male  gender_Other  ever_married_Yes  work_type_Never_worked  \\<br>0            1             0                 1                       0   <br>1            0             0                 1                       0   <br>2            1             0                 1                       0   <br>3            0             0                 1                       0   <br>4            0             0                 1                       0   <br><br>   work_type_Private  work_type_Self-employed  work_type_children  \\<br>0                  1                        0                   0   <br>1                  0                        1                   0   <br>2                  1                        0                   0   <br>3                  1                        0                   0   <br>4                  0                        1                   0   <br><br>   Residence_type_Urban  smoking_status_formerly smoked  \\<br>0                     1                               1   <br>1                     0                               0   <br>2                     0                               0   <br>3                     1                               0   <br>4                     0                               0   <br><br>   smoking_status_never smoked  smoking_status_smokes  <br>0                            0                      0  <br>1                            1                      0  <br>2                            1                      0  <br>3                            0                      1  <br>4                            1                      0  </pre>\n<p>The categorical variables have been successfully one-hot encoded, resulting in additional binary columns for each category.

This step is essential for models that are sensitive to the scale of input features, such as distance-based models.</p>\n<h4>Feature Scaling</h4>\n<p>Feature scaling is a technique used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of the data. Common types of feature scaling methods\u00a0include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Min-Max Scaling</strong>: This method scales the data between 0 and\u00a01.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Standard Scaling (Z-score Normalization)</strong>: This method scales the data based on the mean and standard deviation, resulting in data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of\u00a01.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Robust Scaling</strong>: This method scales the data based on the median and the interquartile range, making it robust to outliers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this analysis, we will use Standard Scaling to scale the numerical features, as it is a common choice and works well in most scenarios. The numerical features to be scaled are \u2018age\u2019, \u2018avg_glucose_level\u2019, and\u00a0\u2018bmi\u2019.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s proceed with scaling these numerical features.</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler<br><br># List of numerical features for scaling<br>numerical_features_for_scaling = ['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi']<br><br># Initialize the StandardScaler<br>scaler = StandardScaler()<br><br># Apply Standard Scaling to the numerical features<br>data_encoded[numerical_features_for_scaling] = scaler.fit_transform(data_encoded[numerical_features_for_scaling])<br><br># Display the first few rows of the scaled dataset<br>data_encoded.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>      id       age  hypertension  heart_disease  avg_glucose_level       bmi  \\<br>0   9046  1.051434             0              1           2.058363  1.110872   <br>1  51676  0.786070             0              0           2.058363 -0.082921   <br>2  31112  1.626390             0              1           0.148256  0.535043   <br>3  60182  0.255342             0              0           2.058363  0.801890   <br>4   1665  1.582163             1              0           2.058363 -0.658751   <br><br>   stroke  gender_Male  gender_Other  ever_married_Yes  \\<br>0       1            1             0                 1   <br>1       1            0             0                 1   <br>2       1            1             0                 1   <br>3       1            0             0                 1   <br>4       1            0             0                 1   <br><br>   work_type_Never_worked  work_type_Private  work_type_Self-employed  \\<br>0                       0                  1                        0   <br>1                       0                  0                        1   <br>2                       0                  1                        0   <br>3                       0                  1                        0   <br>4                       0                  0                        1   <br><br>   work_type_children  Residence_type_Urban  smoking_status_formerly smoked  \\<br>0                   0                     1                               1   <br>1                   0                     0                               0   <br>2                   0                     0                               0   <br>3                   0                     1                               0   <br>4                   0                     0                               0   <br><br>   smoking_status_never smoked  smoking_status_smokes  <br>0                            0                      0  <br>1                            1                      0  <br>2                            1                      0  <br>3                            0                      1  <br>4                            1                      0  </pre>\n<p>The numerical features \u2018age\u2019, \u2018avg_glucose_level\u2019, and \u2018bmi\u2019 have been successfully scaled using Standard Scaling. The scaled features now have a mean of approximately 0 and a standard deviation of\u00a01.</p>\n<p>The next step in the Data Preparation phase is Feature Engineering, where we can create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance. However, given the nature of the dataset and the features available, there don\u2019t appear to be immediate opportunities for creating meaningful new features.</p>\n<p>After Feature Engineering, we would address any class imbalance observed in the target variable. We noted earlier that the dataset is imbalanced with respect to the target variable \u2018stroke\u2019. Addressing this imbalance can involve resampling techniques such as oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or generating synthetic samples.</p>\n<h4>Handling Class Imbalance</h4>\n<p>Class imbalance can lead to a biased model that performs poorly on the minority class. Several techniques can be used to address class imbalance, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Oversampling the Minority Class</strong>: Increasing the number of instances of the minority class by duplicating samples or generating synthetic samples.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Undersampling the Majority Class</strong>: Reducing the number of instances of the majority class by randomly removing\u00a0samples.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Using Different Evaluation Metrics</strong>: Using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC that are more informative than accuracy in imbalanced datasets.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre># Define features (X) and target (y) again<br>X = data_encoded.drop(columns=['id', 'stroke'])<br>y = data_encoded['stroke']<br><br># Concatenate the features and target variable to form the dataset<br>dataset = pd.concat([X, y], axis=1)<br><br># Separate the majority and minority classes<br>majority_class = dataset[dataset['stroke'] == 0]<br>minority_class = dataset[dataset['stroke'] == 1]<br><br># Oversample the minority class<br>minority_class_upsampled = resample(minority_class, <br>                                    replace=True, <br>                                    n_samples=len(majority_class), <br>                                    random_state=42)<br><br># Combine the majority class and the upsampled minority class to form the balanced dataset<br>balanced_dataset = pd.concat([majority_class, minority_class_upsampled])<br><br># Check the class distribution after oversampling<br>class_distribution_after_oversampling = balanced_dataset['stroke'].value_counts(normalize=True)<br>class_distribution_after_oversampling</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>0    0.5<br>1    0.5<br>Name: stroke, dtype: float64</pre>\n<p>After oversampling the minority class, we have successfully balanced the class distribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of the samples belong to the \u201cNo Stroke\u201d class\u00a0(0).</li>\n<li>50% of the samples belong to the \u201cStroke\u201d class\u00a0(1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This balanced dataset should help in training a model that is less biased towards the majority\u00a0class.</p>\n<p>We have now completed the Data Preparation phase, having handled missing values, outliers, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and addressed class imbalance.</p>\n<h3>Phase 4:\u00a0Modeling</h3>\n<p>In the Modeling phase, we will select appropriate modeling techniques, build models, and assess their fit. Given that our task is binary classification (predicting whether a person will have a stroke or not), we will explore the following classification models:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: A simple linear model for binary classification.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Decision Tree Classifier</strong>: A non-linear model that partitions the feature space into regions and assigns a class label to each\u00a0region.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>: An ensemble of decision trees that aggregates their predictions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>: A model that finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature\u00a0space.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Gradient Boosting Classifier</strong>: A boosting algorithm that builds an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each model, we will perform the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Train the Model</strong>: Use the training data to fit the\u00a0model.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Evaluate the Model</strong>: Use the test data to evaluate the model\u2019s performance based on appropriate metrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will start by splitting the balanced dataset into training and testing sets. Then, we will train and evaluate each model one by\u00a0one.</p>\n<h4>Logistic Regression</h4>\n<p>Logistic Regression is one of the simplest algorithms for binary classification.

\u201cOutcome\u201d give us several insights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Pregnancies</strong>: Most women in the dataset have less than 5 pregnancies, with the number decreasing as the number of

These will need to be addressed in the Data Preparation phase.</p>\n<h3>Phase 3: Data Preparation</h3>\n<p>In the Data Preparation phase, we will address the following tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Handle Missing or Incorrect Entries</strong>: Replace the zeros in \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019 with NaN and then impute\u00a0them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Scaling</strong>: Scale the features to bring them to a similar scale, which helps in improving the model\u2019s performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create new features if necessary, based on domain knowledge and the existing features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: If there are any categorical variables, encode them to numerical format.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Splitting the Data:</strong> Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model\u2019s performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with handling the missing or incorrect entries</p>\n<pre>import numpy as np<br><br># List of columns to check for missing or incorrect entries (zeros)<br>columns_with_zeros = ['Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI']<br><br># Replace zeros with NaN in the specified columns<br>diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros] = diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros].replace(0, np.nan)<br><br># Display the number of missing values in each column<br>missing_values_after_replacement = diabetes_df.isnull().sum()<br>missing_values_after_replacement</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>Pregnancies                   0<br>Glucose                       5<br>BloodPressure                35<br>SkinThickness               227<br>Insulin                     374<br>BMI                          11<br>DiabetesPedigreeFunction      0<br>Age                           0<br>Outcome                       0<br>dtype: int64</pre>\n<p>After replacing the zeros with NaN in the columns \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019, we observe the following number of missing values in each\u00a0column:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glucose: 5 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>BloodPressure: 35 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>SkinThickness: 227 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>Insulin: 374 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>BMI: 11 missing\u00a0values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we will impute these missing values. There are various strategies for imputation, such as replacing with the mean, median, or mode of the column, or using more sophisticated methods like model-based imputation. For this exercise, we\u2019ll use the median of the column to replace the missing values, as the median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the\u00a0mean.</p>\n<pre># Impute missing values with the median of the respective columns<br>diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros] = diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()), axis=0)<br><br># Check again for any remaining missing values<br>remaining_missing_values = diabetes_df.isnull().sum()<br>remaining_missing_values</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>Pregnancies                 0<br>Glucose                     0<br>BloodPressure               0<br>SkinThickness               0<br>Insulin                     0<br>BMI                         0<br>DiabetesPedigreeFunction    0<br>Age                         0<br>Outcome                     0<br>dtype: int64</pre>\n<p>The missing values in the columns \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019 have been successfully imputed using the median of each respective column. As a result, there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>Next, we will proceed with feature scaling. Feature scaling is an essential step when the features in the dataset have different ranges or units, as it can help improve the performance of certain machine learning models. We will use StandardScaler to scale the features, which will standardize the feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.</p>\n<h4>Feature Scaling</h4>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler<br><br># Initialize the StandardScaler<br>scaler = StandardScaler()<br><br># Define the features and target variable<br>X = diabetes_df.drop(columns=['Outcome'])<br>y = diabetes_df['Outcome']<br><br># Scale the features<br>X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X), columns=X.columns)<br><br># Display the first few rows of scaled features<br>X_scaled.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>   Pregnancies   Glucose  BloodPressure  SkinThickness   Insulin       BMI  \\<br>0     0.639947  0.866045      -0.031990       0.670643 -0.181541  0.166619   <br>1    -0.844885 -1.205066      -0.528319      -0.012301 -0.181541 -0.852200   <br>2     1.233880  2.016662      -0.693761      -0.012301 -0.181541 -1.332500   <br>3    -0.844885 -1.073567      -0.528319      -0.695245 -0.540642 -0.633881   <br>4    -1.141852  0.504422      -2.679076       0.670643  0.316566  1.549303   <br><br>   DiabetesPedigreeFunction       Age  <br>0                  0.468492  1.425995  <br>1                 -0.365061 -0.190672  <br>2                  0.604397 -0.105584  <br>3                 -0.920763 -1.041549  <br>4                  5.484909 -0.020496  </pre>\n<p>The features have been successfully scaled using the StandardScaler.

In this dataset, all the features are numeric, and there are no categorical variables to encode. Additionally, we do not have specific domain knowledge to create new features at this point, so we will not perform feature engineering.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will split the data into training and testing sets.

Notably, features such as Glucose, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age played pivotal roles in determining whether a patient is likely to have diabetes. Understanding the significance of these features can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Exploration and Visualization</strong>: Our exploration of the dataset uncovered trends, distributions, and relationships among variables. Visualization allowed us to identify correlations between certain features and the likelihood of diabetes. Additionally, it helped us identify the presence of outliers in some features, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment and Future Work</strong>: The Random Forest model has been finalized and is ready for deployment. Continuous monitoring and maintenance are recommended to ensure sustained performance. Future research endeavors could involve exploring additional features, experimenting with alternative modeling techniques, and assessing real-world deployment scenarios.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, this study exemplifies the effectiveness of the CRISP-DM methodology in guiding the development of predictive models for critical healthcare applications.

\u201cOutcome\u201d give us several insights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Pregnancies</strong>: Most women in the dataset have less than 5 pregnancies, with the number decreasing as the number of pregnancies increases.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Glucose</strong>: There is a spike at 0, which is not a practical value and indicates missing or incorrect entries. The distribution is somewhat right-skewed, with most values centered around\u00a0100\u2013140.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>BloodPressure</strong>: There is a spike at 0, indicating missing or incorrect entries.

These will need to be addressed in the Data Preparation phase.</p>\n<h3>Phase 3: Data Preparation</h3>\n<p>In the Data Preparation phase, we will address the following tasks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Handle Missing or Incorrect Entries</strong>: Replace the zeros in \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019 with NaN and then impute\u00a0them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Scaling</strong>: Scale the features to bring them to a similar scale, which helps in improving the model\u2019s performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Create new features if necessary, based on domain knowledge and the existing features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encoding Categorical Variables</strong>: If there are any categorical variables, encode them to numerical format.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Splitting the Data:</strong> Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model\u2019s performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with handling the missing or incorrect entries</p>\n<pre>import numpy as np<br><br># List of columns to check for missing or incorrect entries (zeros)<br>columns_with_zeros = ['Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI']<br><br># Replace zeros with NaN in the specified columns<br>diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros] = diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros].replace(0, np.nan)<br><br># Display the number of missing values in each column<br>missing_values_after_replacement = diabetes_df.isnull().sum()<br>missing_values_after_replacement</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>Pregnancies                   0<br>Glucose                       5<br>BloodPressure                35<br>SkinThickness               227<br>Insulin                     374<br>BMI                          11<br>DiabetesPedigreeFunction      0<br>Age                           0<br>Outcome                       0<br>dtype: int64</pre>\n<p>After replacing the zeros with NaN in the columns \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019, we observe the following number of missing values in each\u00a0column:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glucose: 5 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>BloodPressure: 35 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>SkinThickness: 227 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>Insulin: 374 missing\u00a0values</li>\n<li>BMI: 11 missing\u00a0values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we will impute these missing values. There are various strategies for imputation, such as replacing with the mean, median, or mode of the column, or using more sophisticated methods like model-based imputation. For this exercise, we\u2019ll use the median of the column to replace the missing values, as the median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the\u00a0mean.</p>\n<pre># Impute missing values with the median of the respective columns<br>diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros] = diabetes_df[columns_with_zeros].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()), axis=0)<br><br># Check again for any remaining missing values<br>remaining_missing_values = diabetes_df.isnull().sum()<br>remaining_missing_values</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>Pregnancies                 0<br>Glucose                     0<br>BloodPressure               0<br>SkinThickness               0<br>Insulin                     0<br>BMI                         0<br>DiabetesPedigreeFunction    0<br>Age                         0<br>Outcome                     0<br>dtype: int64</pre>\n<p>The missing values in the columns \u2018Glucose\u2019, \u2018BloodPressure\u2019, \u2018SkinThickness\u2019, \u2018Insulin\u2019, and \u2018BMI\u2019 have been successfully imputed using the median of each respective column. As a result, there are no remaining missing values in the\u00a0dataset.</p>\n<p>Next, we will proceed with feature scaling. Feature scaling is an essential step when the features in the dataset have different ranges or units, as it can help improve the performance of certain machine learning models. We will use StandardScaler to scale the features, which will standardize the feature by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.</p>\n<h4>Feature Scaling</h4>\n<pre>from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler<br><br># Initialize the StandardScaler<br>scaler = StandardScaler()<br><br># Define the features and target variable<br>X = diabetes_df.drop(columns=['Outcome'])<br>y = diabetes_df['Outcome']<br><br># Scale the features<br>X_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(X), columns=X.columns)<br><br># Display the first few rows of scaled features<br>X_scaled.head()</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>   Pregnancies   Glucose  BloodPressure  SkinThickness   Insulin       BMI  \\<br>0     0.639947  0.866045      -0.031990       0.670643 -0.181541  0.166619   <br>1    -0.844885 -1.205066      -0.528319      -0.012301 -0.181541 -0.852200   <br>2     1.233880  2.016662      -0.693761      -0.012301 -0.181541 -1.332500   <br>3    -0.844885 -1.073567      -0.528319      -0.695245 -0.540642 -0.633881   <br>4    -1.141852  0.504422      -2.679076       0.670643  0.316566  1.549303   <br><br>   DiabetesPedigreeFunction       Age  <br>0                  0.468492  1.425995  <br>1                 -0.365061 -0.190672  <br>2                  0.604397 -0.105584  <br>3                 -0.920763 -1.041549  <br>4                  5.484909 -0.020496  </pre>\n<p>The features have been successfully scaled using the StandardScaler.

In this dataset, all the features are numeric, and there are no categorical variables to encode. Additionally, we do not have specific domain knowledge to create new features at this point, so we will not perform feature engineering.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will split the data into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning models, and the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance.</p>\n<pre>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split<br><br># Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing)<br>X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)<br><br># Display the shape of the training and testing sets<br>(X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape)</pre>\n<pre>RESULT<br>((614, 8), (154, 8), (614,), (154,))</pre>\n<p>The dataset has been successfully split into training and testing sets.

With an accuracy of 77.92%, precision of 72.73%, recall of 59.26%, F1 score of 65.31%, and an AUC-ROC score of 73.63%, the Random Forest model outperformed its counterparts.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Feature Importance Analysis</strong>: Feature importance analysis shed light on the factors driving accurate predictions. Notably, features such as Glucose, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age played pivotal roles in determining whether a patient is likely to have diabetes. Understanding the significance of these features can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Exploration and Visualization</strong>: Our exploration of the dataset uncovered trends, distributions, and relationships among variables. Visualization allowed us to identify correlations between certain features and the likelihood of diabetes. Additionally, it helped us identify the presence of outliers in some features, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment and Future Work</strong>: The Random Forest model has been finalized and is ready for deployment. Continuous monitoring and maintenance are recommended to ensure sustained performance. Future research endeavors could involve exploring additional features, experimenting with alternative modeling techniques, and assessing real-world deployment scenarios.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion, this study exemplifies the effectiveness of the CRISP-DM methodology in guiding the development of predictive models for critical healthcare applications. The Random Forest Classifier, informed by feature importance and data exploration, stands as a valuable tool for diagnosing diabetes, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare decision-making.

The CRISP-DM model is widely used in the industry for structuring data science projects and it generally comprises six\u00a0phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Understanding</strong>: Identifying objectives, defining the\u00a0problem.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Understanding</strong>: Collecting data, exploring data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Cleaning and transforming data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Modeling</strong>: Building predictive or descriptive models.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Evaluation</strong>: Assessing the\u00a0models.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deployment</strong>: Implementing the models into business operations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this article, we will focus on the first four steps, as the last two steps often require integration into a broader business context that we don\u2019t have access to in this\u00a0setting.</p>\n<h4>Mindmap of the Current\u00a0Step</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>CRISP-DM Phase</strong>: Business Understanding</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Task:</strong> Defining the problem and setting objectives</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Objectives and Problem Statement</h4>\n<p>For this exercise, our primary objective is to build a model to predict the profitability of sales at a superstore. Our goals are multi-faceted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the factors that contribute to profitability.</li>\n<li>Prepare the data for analysis.</li>\n<li>Build predictive models for profitability.</li>\n<li>Evaluate and compare these models against a baseline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Next Steps</h4>\n<p>The next step in the CRISP-DM methodology is \u201cData Understanding.\u201d This step will\u00a0involve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Loading the\u00a0dataset</li>\n<li>Conducting a preliminary examination of the\u00a0data</li>\n<li>Running some basic statistics</li>\n<li>Generating some initial visualizations</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1.

Conclusion</strong></h3>\n<p>In this data science project, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology to predict the profitability of sales at a superstore. We started with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, uncovering key insights into sales, profits, and customer segments. The data was then meticulously cleaned and prepared, addressing outliers and selecting relevant features. We trained multiple regression models, including <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, <strong>Decision Tree</strong>, and <strong>Random Forest Regressors</strong>, and evaluated their performance against a baseline model. The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the most effective, outperforming all other models across metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
